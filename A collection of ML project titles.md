- [/] [[(ML Project) Question Answering Over Documents]]
- [x] [[(ML Project) How to build a GAN Model on MNIST Dataset for generating new images of handwritten digits?]] 
- [x] [[(ML Project) Build your own chatbot]]
- [ ] Identifying Deep fake images (See [[(ML Project) How to build a GAN Model on MNIST Dataset for generating new images of handwritten digits?]] end part)
- [ ] **Smart Urban Planning:** Create models to improve traffic and city development.
	1. Can we do this for Mumbai? BUT: data collection 
		1. Check if data for any other cities available public 
- [ ] **Real-time Language Translation:** Make systems that translate and give pronunciation tips for better global communication.
- [ ] [Deep Learning Project for Text Detection in Images using Python](https://www.projectpro.io/project-use-case/text-detection-in-images-using-python) 
- [ ] [Building an End-to-End Predictive Maintenance Machine Learning Application \[MLOps\] | by Abhishek Chandragiri | Medium](https://medium.com/@abhishekgoud1212/building-an-end-to-end-predictive-maintenance-machine-learning-application-mlops-ecff82f5d103)   
- [ ] [[Gen AI Projects in Coursera]] 
- [ ]  developing a recommendation system to suggest personalized products for customers (e-commerce)

### My Ideas
- [ ] Book suggestion bot: Which book to read next? 
	- choose from genres
	- last read books
- [ ] Create a chatbot for Ojus's publication page: similar to adobe pdf ai - you can ask questions about his work and AI gives answers based on his publications - similar to ai apps where we can upload pdf and interact with it - here we all upload multiple pdfs (or fine-tune on multiple pdfs)
- [ ] app that helps users improve their English speaking skills through AI-powered feedback and practice. : continuous audio input (conversation style) & get live or feedback as the user stops audio input (press enter)
	- eg: [AISpeak:Deepgram](https://deepgram.com/ai-apps/aispeak) - 60-second audio responses to test questions, [SmallTalk2Me](https://smalltalk2.me/) - mock interview practice, vocab boost etc - with 1 to 15mts long audio.
- [ ] create an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) based command recognition system tailored for a low-resource Indian language. : **VERY IMP** - in CV 
	- [ ] check if we can collaborate with mal girl 

### Problem Statements from [bnomial](https://today.bnomial.com/) 
- Mariam built a machine learning model that looks at pictures of mechanical components and predicts whether they need maintenance.
