- extension of DFS
	- In DFS, you traverse through a pre-built structure (tree or graph).
	- In back-tracking, you have to built the structure yourself (dynamically)
	- backtracking builds a solution tree dynamically by making decisions at each node.
		- abandons path if it fails to meet the criteria
	- recursion
	- **Common use-cases**: *Combinatorial Problems*
		- Permutations, combinations, puzzles (like Sudoku), and constraint satisfaction problems.
