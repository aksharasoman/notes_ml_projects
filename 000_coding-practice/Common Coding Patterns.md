Coding patterns are general, reusable solutions to common problems that you might encounter in programming, especially during interviews or software development. 

1. **Two Pointers**:
   - Used to traverse data structures like arrays or linked lists with two different pointers moving at different speeds.
   - **Common use-cases**: Finding pairs that meet a condition, removing duplicates, and detecting cycles in a linked list.

2. **Sliding Window**:
   - Involves creating a window that slides over the data to solve problems related to contiguous subarrays.
   - **Common use-cases**: Maximum sum subarray, finding substrings, and other problems that require maintaining a dynamic range.

3. **Binary Search**:
   - A divide-and-conquer approach to search for a target value in a sorted data structure.
   - **Common use-cases**: Searching, finding bounds, and optimized problem-solving with logarithmic complexity.

4. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**:
   - Solving problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing their results.
   - **Common use-cases**: Optimization problems like the Knapsack problem, Fibonacci sequence, and pathfinding.

5. **Backtracking**:
   - A recursive approach to solve problems by exploring all possible solutions and abandoning a path if it fails to meet the criteria.
   - **Common use-cases**: Permutations, combinations, puzzles (like Sudoku), and constraint satisfaction problems.

6. **Greedy Algorithm**:
   - Building up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most immediate benefit.
   - **Common use-cases**: Problems involving minimal spanning trees, shortest paths, and scheduling tasks.

7. **Graph Traversal (BFS/DFS)**:
   - Techniques for exploring nodes and edges in a graph systematically.
   - **Common use-cases**: Finding connected components, shortest paths, and cycles in graphs.

8. **Divide and Conquer**:
   - Breaking a problem into smaller subproblems, solving each independently, and combining the results.
   - **Common use-cases**: Sorting algorithms like merge sort and quicksort, and searching in multidimensional data.

9. **Topological Sorting**:
   - Ordering vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) such that for every directed edge, the start comes before the end.
   - **Common use-cases**: Task scheduling, dependency resolution, and project planning.

### **Why Coding Patterns Matter**
- **Efficiency**: Knowing these patterns helps you come up with optimized solutions more quickly.
- **Reusability**: Once you master these patterns, you can adapt them to solve different variations of problems.
- **Interview Success**: Most technical interview problems are based on these fundamental patterns.
