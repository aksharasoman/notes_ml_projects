### **Background**

Google’s [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) is an interesting new tool built by the team at Google that can take in sources (articles, books, videos), and automatically generate a realistic sounding podcast conversation based on it. Here’s a demo of [someone using it on Twitter](https://x.com/emollick/status/1836480689081913572).

### **Task**

You task will be to create a simpler version of this and break down how you did it via a tutorial post. More specifically, you will *build a function on Sieve that*:

- downloads a YouTube video
- summarizes it into a conversational style
- converts the summary into conversation speech between two people
- bonus: [make a talking avatar](https://www.sievedata.com/blog/portrait-avatar-talking-head-video-api-hedra-infinity) or a set of talking avatars speaking that speech

You will then write a short tutorial blog post on how you built it and why it’s useful.

### **Deliverables**

- Code repository with the demo
- A Google Doc of a blog post (*A tutorial post*- break down how you did it)
