Here is a list of some errors that occurred during the implementation of the project. If you encounter them during your own implementation, please refer to the solutions or workarounds I used below.

-  Warning Message from Gemini model when we incorporate a system instruction to the model initialization.

-  VSCode Shortcuts Triggered When Typing on TextInput: When I type letter 'a' in the textinput (panel library element), Jupyter notebook creates new code cell.
